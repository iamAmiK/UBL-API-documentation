First read the README file so you know our features. This code below tests all our API endpoints and you don't have to do anything!!!

Test with either the Swagger or Postman linked below.

Swagger: https://iamamik.github.io/UBL-API-documentation/

Postman: https://amitabhk-8884800.postman.co/workspace/Amitabh-K's-Workspace~cea0c384-efd6-457d-8547-d860f4c6d6c1/collection/43573699-56f3827a-1cdc-4014-bbe3-c7c6a8169c1a?action=share&creator=43573699

**Note: The email endpoints won't work because it is not testing with the AWS deployment. But it does work for sure, if you want to use our API i can send the AWS version which has the email endpoints. Contact @ z5480896@ad.unsw.edu.au**

In the tests folder there are some sample valid/invalid order documents and invoices which you can use for testing.
