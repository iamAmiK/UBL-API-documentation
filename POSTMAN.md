First read the TESTING.md file then you can check this. This code below tests all our API endpoints and you don't have to do anything!!!

**Note: The email endpoints won't work because it is not testing with the AWS deployment. But it does work for sure, if you want to use our API i can send the aws version which has the email endpoints.**
