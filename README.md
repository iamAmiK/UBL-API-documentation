# UBL API documentation: Invoice Generation and Validation

Welcome to Guard's repository. 

## Deployment

We have three deployments, two for production and one for testing. Of our production deployments one has varying cold start (10ms to 50ms) and another has no cold starts. Our testing deployment has a severe cold start (20 sec). 

As all deployments, once the cold start has passed the API will be fully accessible with speed. Please use our Testing deployment and if you like our features, email at z5480896@ad.unsw.edu.au and we will send over links to both Production deployments.
